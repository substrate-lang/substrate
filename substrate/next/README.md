An experiment: the compiler written in a C-like Lisp, the C example's
(`examples/c`) as the new compiler builds it (`c/`), so that reading,
expanding and compiling need no GC. It is ported from `compiler/` file by
file. It builds itself, from a seed, as the compiler does; the compiler
built its first stage, and nothing in `compiler/`, `lib/` or `host/`
changes for it.

The stack it aims at is the wasm kernel, then a C-like Lisp, then
Substrate as a library on it, able to drop into it, then Bend. Syntax
objects live in the compiler's memory, and the macros of every layer work
on them there.

## Layout

- `compiler/`, the new compiler, its files after `compiler/`'s:
  - `kernel.sub`: the kernel module (below): `compiler/kernel.sub`, with
    its data, syntax objects among them, in memory; and what
    `compiler/stx.sub` has on them.
  - `numbers.sub`: `compiler/numbers.sub`, with the reading and writing of
    decimals that the old compiler takes from Substrate.
  - `host.sub`: `compiler/host.sub`, with reading and writing files.
  - `reader.sub`: `compiler/reader.sub`.
  - `core.sub`: `compiler/core.sub`, with its infos as C structs, each
    with a record, a datum, that stands for it in lowered code.
  - `ops.sub`: `compiler/ops.sub`.
  - `expander.sub`: `compiler/expander.sub`, but for the cache and
    compiled files, which it says it does not do yet.
  - `running.sub`: the build that runs the compiler, as the compiler
    reads it: its program's list of linklets, and a linklet's exports and
    imports.
  - `leb128.sub`, `wasm.sub`, `closures.sub`, `serialize.sub` and
    `compile.sub`: the compiler's, into buffers and arenas.
  - `main.sub`: `compiler/main.sub`, with its `build`, `compile` and
    `expand` commands.
- `c/`: the C-like Lisp, `examples/c` as the new compiler builds it,
  which the compiler's sources are written in:
  - `lang.sub`: `examples/c/lang.sub`, its transformers in kernel code,
    function for function. C code quotes data and syntax (`'d`, `#'x`),
    typed as the kernel module's `datum`, with `kernel.sub`'s templates
    `` `t `` and `` #`t ``.
  - `runtime.sub`, `math.sub` and `c.sub`: `examples/c`'s.
  - `syntax-match.sub`: `lib/substrate.sub`'s patterns for syntax, in
    kernel code, on the kernel module's syntax objects, its code kernel
    code; `c-syntax-match.sub`, the same, its code C, for macros written
    in C; `patterns.sub`, what the two share: the pattern words, the
    parser and the error when no clause matches.
  - `kernel-forms.sub`: forms that kernel code is written with, `cond`,
    `and`, `or`, `when`, `unless` and `case`, and Racket's `for` forms on
    lists, its `for` named `for/each`, as `lib/substrate-core.sub` gives
    Substrate its forms.
- `substrate/`: Substrate as the new compiler builds it, on the C-like
  Lisp (plan, 5):
  - `data.sub`: its data, `compiler/kernel.sub`'s but for its syntax
    objects, as wasm GC objects; and its `quote`, which makes a datum as
    its value, once, when the module that quotes it starts.
- `seed/`: a build of the new compiler by itself, checked in, as `seed/`
  is the compiler's.
- `sub`: runs the new compiler as `bin/sub` runs the compiler; when its
  sources changed, it first builds them with the seed, and them again
  with that build, into `build/next/sub`: `next/sub build FILE`.
- `bootstrap.sh`: the fixpoint: `build/next/sub` builds itself into the
  same bytes; `next/bootstrap.sh seed` then makes it the seed.
- `compare.sh`: every `.sub` file of the repository expanded, or built,
  by both compilers, which must give the same, a program's linklets byte
  for byte, but where the new compiler differs by design.
- `tests/`: the new compiler's own tests, which it builds (`run.sh`): the
  kernel's tests of compile-time code and of `syntax-match`, on the new
  kernel module; the C example's tests (`tests/c`), on `c/`; and the
  tests of its parts: its syntax objects, its reader, and what its
  expander and back end give for the kernel's tests, which is what the
  compiler gives.

## The kernel module

The kernel module (spec 1.2) holds the data of every language built on
the kernel, syntax objects among them, and the functions of the macro
contract (spec 2). The old compiler's, `compiler/kernel.sub`, has them as
GC objects; the new compiler's is `kernel.sub`, with the data in memory,
with the run-time modules it rests on, which give it its memory and
allocator: `lib/print.sub`'s memory, and `c/`'s `sbrk`, stack and
allocator. The GC kernel module is not part of the new compiler: the
kernel language keeps wasm's GC types and instructions, and a language
that wants GC data, as Substrate will, defines its own.

- **Data** are `i32`s, the addresses of `kernel.sub`'s cells, which macros
  make and take apart with its functions, the old kernel module's under
  their names but for `integer` and `flonum`, which are `make-integer` and
  `make-flonum`, and its string builders, which are `lib/print.sub`'s
  buffers. `quote`, `quasiquote`, `quote-syntax` and `quasisyntax` make
  them: a linklet's quoted data is serialized into a data segment, which
  `kernel.sub` reads into the current arena when the linklet starts,
  mapping a syntax object's scopes to the run's (spec 3.5); so a linklet
  that quotes data, at any phase, has the kernel module's memory for its
  own.
- **A syntax error** is `kernel.sub`'s `compile-error` exception, which
  holds the message, the syntax blamed and a source location, where the
  old kernel module throws a syntax error value with its `exn` tag.
- **Compile-time code** links to the running compiler's instances of the
  kernel module, as the old compiler's links to its running kernel's
  (spec 1.4), so the compiler and every macro share its data, memory and
  allocator: the kernel module's whole group, `kernel.sub` and the
  run-time modules it rests on, at any phase shift, whether a module
  requires it as `kernel` or requires them by path. So a macro can be
  written in the C-like Lisp, a C function at phase 1 on the kernel
  module's data (`tests/c-macros.sub`), as well as in kernel code.
  `(require k kernel)` binds `kernel.sub`'s functions and tags,
  at any phase, and `(memory from k)` and `(table from k)` take its
  memory and table; a linklet at phase 1 or above that declares none
  takes them too. The compiler is given the directory of the build that
  runs it (`-r DIR`, which `next/sub` passes), whose program lists the
  linklets the host registered, and reads `kernel.sub`'s functions from
  its linklet there.
- **A transformer** is a function pointer, an index in the shared table,
  to a function from syntax to syntax, `(i32) -> i32`, or from an
  environment and syntax, `(make-transformer (func-index code) env)`.
  `define-syntax` values are data too. The expander calls a macro
  directly, through the table.
- **A program** that uses the kernel module carries the running build's
  linklets of it, but for those it compiled itself: when the compiler
  builds itself, `kernel.sub` compiled from source has the running
  kernel's name, the same module (spec 3.2), and the program has the
  bytes this build compiled, while compile-time code still links to the
  running build's kernel module.

Code written for the old compiler's kernel module, its GC data and
syntax objects, Substrate among it, does not run on the new compiler:
Substrate is to be built again on the C-like Lisp (plan, 5).

## Plan

1. Syntax objects, then the reader. Done: the reader reads the compiler's
   and the libraries' files as `compiler/reader.sub` does, datum for
   datum and location for location.
2. The expander, compiling to wasm, and compile-time code and phases.
   The kernel's tests are the check. Done: every file of the repository
   whose meaning the new compiler keeps, the kernel's tests among them,
   it expands and builds as the compiler does, byte for byte, its errors
   and what compile-time code prints included; and the kernel's tests of
   compile-time code, in the new kernel module (`tests/`), give their
   tests' output.
3. `syntax-match`, from `lib/substrate.sub`'s patterns, on the kernel
   module's syntax objects. Done: `c/syntax-match.sub`, in kernel code,
   gives the kernel's tests of it, ported to `tests/`, their output:
   `tests/syntax-match.sub`'s, and its error tests' messages.
4. The C-like Lisp, `examples/c/lang.sub`, as macros on the kernel
   module, written in kernel code, as `lib/substrate-core.sub` writes
   Substrate's, with its run-time part in the kernel module; then the C
   example's tests, and the compiler compiling itself, to a fixpoint,
   the current build its first stage. Done: `c/lang.sub` has its
   transformers in kernel code; the C example's tests, in `tests/c`,
   give their outputs and errors on it; the compiler's sources are
   written in it, `kernel.sub`'s own macros in kernel code; and the
   build the compiler made of them built them into a compiler that
   builds itself into the same bytes, the seed.
5. Substrate and Bend on the C-like Lisp, which is the base language:
   the kernel's specification is what code compiles to, and C is what it
   is written in, with the kernel's instructions in `func` bodies.
   Macros are written in C, and need no GC; Substrate's values are wasm
   GC objects, its run time in `func` bodies. In order:
   1. C as a language for macros: quoted data and syntax in C code, and
      `syntax-match` for C. Done: `tests/c-macros.sub`,
      `tests/c-quote.sub`, and `tests/c/syntax-match.sub`, the kernel's
      test of `syntax-match` in C, which gives its output.
   2. Substrate's data, the old kernel module's GC data but syntax, and
      its literals, made when a module starts. Done: `substrate/data.sub`
      (`tests/substrate/data.sub`).
   3. Substrate's forms, and pattern macros for Substrate's users.
   4. Numeric instructions and reference types in C code.
   5. The typed example; then Bend, its checker first-order, in C.
